# Setup and Usage

- Not all requirements are implemented in the Pharmacy System solution as the documented version will not be used for on-ground use.
As described in the [requirements section](./intro.md#user-storiesfeatures) this server-side solution is built to serve two types of clients: Pharmacist and Manager clients, so a client-side solution should be built to make this piece of software (**Pharmacy System**) usable!

- Clients of Pharmacy Systems can be desktop applications, mobile applications, or websites! but it is expected to be a desktop application as described by a pharmacist.

- Pharmacy System is designed to be deployed (published) on self-managed servers or cloud providers like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), it is a flexible solution that is built from scratch to be deployable anywhere without a vendor-lock trap! for more technical details in this area please visit the [Infrastructure section](./Technical-details/infrastructure).

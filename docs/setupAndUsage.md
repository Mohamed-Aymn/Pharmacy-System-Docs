# Setup and Usage

- As described in [requirements section](./intro.md#user-storiesfeatures) this server side solution is built to server two types of clients: Pharmacist and Manager clients, so a client side solution should be built to make this piece of software (**Pharmacy System**) usable!

- Clients of **Pharmacy System** can be desktop application, mobile application, or a website! but it is expected to be a desktop application as described by pharmacist.

- **Pharmacy System** is designed to be deployed (published) on self-managed servers or on cloud providers like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), it is a flexible solution that is built from scratch to be deploy-able anywhere without vendor-lock trap! for more technical details in this area please visit  [Infrastructure section](./Technical-details/infrastructure).
